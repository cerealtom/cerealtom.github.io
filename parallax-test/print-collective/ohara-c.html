<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
<p>My recent work has concentrated on the death of a phobia, or at least the passing of one feeling into another.  The loss of a strong feeling, be it fear, love or loneliness is at the core of this work. The image of the dead bird obviously symbolised death, but also paradoxically hope, ideas of re-birth and the mythological winged creature carrying the soul to the next world inform this work.</p>
<p>For me birds have always caused an uneasiness to well inside me, manifesting as a phobia. They exist in our world and yet seem far removed from us mammals.  Their physical make-up, movement, soft bodies and hard beaks all balanced on such skinny legs with their clawed toes have always invoked an uncomfortableness within me.  Their world of flight and song is removed form ours and has always created wonder in man.  Fear is mostly concentrated in the unknown so by studying the avian form in detail these feelings subsided.  As a method to overcome strong unwanted feelings, studying and reproducing has become a cathartic experience.  And with it the bird/wing image has come to embody a liberation within my work and myself. The image of the dead bird creates a sense of lost hope and opportunity for freedom.  Their fragility now overtakes their power.</p>
<p>Through using paper and porcelain as my media, I wish to emphasis this fragility.  Space in my work is often ambiguous, in a way, removing a sense of either the interior or exterior space.   No connotations can be made when the subject belongs to an invisible or unrecognisable space, detached from its usual form.  And it is in this environment that the ordinary can be looked upon anew.</p>
